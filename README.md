# Gemini-Python-based-app# Gemini Text Summarizer

## ðŸ“Œ What the app does
This is a simple Streamlit web app that uses Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro model to:
- Summarize any English paragraph or uploaded `.txt` file.
- Translate English text into Arabic with the click of a button.

## ðŸŽ¯ What was challenging or fun
The challenging part was configuring the right Python version and dependencies to make Streamlit and Gemini work smoothly together. Once that was set up, it was fun building a clean interface and seeing real-time AI responses from a web UI.

## ðŸ§  What I learned
I learned how to:
- Use the Gemini SDK to generate content from text.
- Build a basic yet interactive Streamlit app.
- Handle user inputs like file uploads and API responses.
- Translate text programmatically using the same AI model.
